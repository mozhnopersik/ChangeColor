# Change color
It's my first app :)
I made it during my SwiftBook training.

### The task was:
Make an application in which the user can change the background color of the view using sliders. The meaning of each slider should be displayed in the corresponding label. The color of the slider to the left of the slider should correspond to the color for which it is responsible.
